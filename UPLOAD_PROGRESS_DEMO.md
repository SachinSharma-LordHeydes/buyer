# Upload Progress Modal Demo

## How It Works

The new upload progress modal replaces the skeleton loader and provides real-time feedback on the upload process. Here's what happens:

### Add Product Page
1. **Before Upload**: User fills out product form normally
2. **Click Save/Publish**: Modal opens immediately showing upload steps
3. **Real-time Progress**: Shows detailed progress for each step:
   - **Uploading Images**: Shows progress per image (e.g., "Uploading image 2 of 5...")
   - **Uploading Videos**: Shows progress per video (e.g., "Uploading video 1 of 2...")
   - **Creating Product**: Shows database save progress
4. **Completion**: Success message and auto-redirect to products page

### Edit Product Page
1. **Before Upload**: User edits product details
2. **Click Save/Update**: Modal opens showing only necessary steps
3. **Smart Detection**: Only shows steps for new media (doesn't re-upload existing files)
4. **Real-time Progress**: Same detailed feedback as add product
5. **Completion**: Success message and redirect

## Progress Steps Example

```
Overall Progress: 65%

üîÑ Uploading Images (3)        ‚úÖ Completed
   Successfully uploaded 3 images

üîÑ Uploading Videos (1)        üîµ 50%
   Uploading video 1 of 1...

‚ö™ Creating Product            ‚è≥ Pending
   Waiting...

Current Status: Uploading Videos
```

## Key Features

### ‚úÖ **Real-time Feedback**
- Shows exact progress percentages
- Updates as each file uploads
- Provides detailed status messages

### ‚úÖ **Smart Step Management**
- Only shows relevant steps
- Skips empty steps (e.g., no videos = no video step)
- Different labels for add vs edit operations

### ‚úÖ **Error Handling**
- Shows errors at the step level
- Maintains modal state for debugging
- Provides clear error messages

### ‚úÖ **User Experience**
- Cannot be dismissed during upload
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Clear visual indicators for each state

### ‚úÖ **No More Skeleton Loaders**
- Removed skeleton loaders that appeared after clicking save
- Buttons are disabled during upload instead
- Users can see exactly what's happening

## Code Implementation

### Using the Hook
```typescript
const uploadProgress = useUploadProgress();

// Initialize steps
uploadProgress.initializeSteps([
  { id: 'images', label: 'Uploading Images', icon: <ImageIcon /> },
  { id: 'videos', label: 'Uploading Videos', icon: <Video /> },
  { id: 'product', label: 'Creating Product', icon: <Package /> }
]);

// Start upload process
uploadProgress.openModal();

// Update progress
uploadProgress.startStep('images', 'Starting image upload...');
uploadProgress.updateStepProgress('images', 50, 'Uploading image 2 of 4...');
uploadProgress.completeStep('images', 'Successfully uploaded 4 images');
```

### Modal Component
```jsx
<UploadProgressModal
  open={uploadProgress.isOpen}
  onOpenChange={uploadProgress.closeModal}
  steps={uploadProgress.steps}
  currentStep={uploadProgress.currentStep}
  overallProgress={uploadProgress.overallProgress}
  title="Creating Product"
/>
```

## Benefits

1. **Better UX**: Users know exactly what's happening and how long it might take
2. **No Confusion**: No more wondering if the app is frozen during uploads
3. **Error Visibility**: Clear feedback when something goes wrong
4. **Progress Tracking**: Real percentages instead of indeterminate loading
5. **Professional Feel**: Looks more polished and modern

## When Modal Appears

The modal **ONLY** appears:
- ‚úÖ After clicking "Save Product" or "Update Product" 
- ‚úÖ When there are actual files to upload or product to save
- ‚úÖ During the actual upload/save process

The modal **NEVER** appears:
- ‚ùå On page load
- ‚ùå When navigating between form steps
- ‚ùå When validation fails
- ‚ùå When just viewing or editing form fields
